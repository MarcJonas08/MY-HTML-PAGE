        <p style="width: 70%; text-align: justify;">Hello! I am Marc Jonas Diaz, I've been into cars since I was a kid. My interest to Cars
            began when I watched the fast and the furious movie back in 2009. Since then, I have 
            been fascinated by the mechanics, design, and performance of various car models. 
            I enjoy keeping up with the latest automotive trends and attending car shows whenever
             possible. My dream is to own a collection of classic and high-performance cars one day. 
             This also became my inspiration to thrive for a better life because if I won't be a successful man
             some day, these dream will still be a dream forever. 
        </p>
